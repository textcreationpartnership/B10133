            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ONE would think, that after ſo many Inſtances of Divine Juſtice againſt Malefactors, Men would at laſt, begin to be ſo Wiſe, as to beware of ſuch Courſes that naturally tend to ſuch deplorable Ends. But, Alaſs! notwithſtanding all the Exemplary Puniſhments which we ſee daily inflicted upon Criminals, too many <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 chunk">
                  <desc>…</desc>
               </gap>n on in their Wicked courſes, and never ſtop, till the Juſtice of God lays hold upon them, and they by this means, Ruine themſelves, at leaſt as to this Life, (if not likewiſe as to that which is to come, ſince, as Divines ſay, <hi>Late Repentance is ſeldom true.)</hi> Would Men but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon the ſad Conſequences of evil Courſes before they enter upon them, it cannot be ſuppoſed they would ſo eaſily give themſelves over to them, but we too often find, that by Men's heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs running upon one Sin, that makes way for another, and that again for a third; and ſo they go on, till at laſt they make themſelves an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:185106:2"/> Example of Juſtice, as we have many times before obſerved, and now of late at the Execution of the following Priſoners. But I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give you an Account of their Confeſſions and laſt Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Thompſon,</hi> who was Condemned for Breaking open the Houſe of <hi>Edward Mullins,</hi> and Stealing thence a Silver Salt, three Silver Spoons and 40 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, with other Goods, Confeſſed that he had been a Lewd liver and had been guilty of many Crimes, and particularly, that he committed that Murther upon <hi>Dorothy Stanton,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Philip St<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ton,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Lump</hi>'s) in <hi>Fig-lane,</hi> on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1685. For whith and all his other Crimes, he ſeemed very Penitent, and asked Forgiveneſs of the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> her Husband, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Execution. He was frequently heard to repeat theſe Words, <hi>Whither ſhall I go in a few Minutes?</hi> He likewiſe ſaid, that it was not the bare apprehenſion of Death, or of loſing this World, that Troubled him, but that he was amazed at the thoughts of appearing before the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Tribunal of God, having lived ſo profligate a Villain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Crook</hi> alias <hi>Hide, and John Atkins</hi> alias <hi>Luſh,</hi> Condemned as Brethren in Iniquity, for Breaking open the Houſe of <hi>William Hollyer,</hi> and Stealing thence two Pieces of Scarlet Cloath, both notorious Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but now very Penitent. Among other things, <hi>Hide</hi> Confeſſed, that he Robbed my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Soho-Square,</hi> with a great many other Thefts and Villanies, having continued that courſe of Life for above theſe Nine or Ten Years; for though he was but a Stripling being not above 17 Years, yet he had been no Novice in Villany. He ſadly regretted his being drawn away by bad Company, but above all, he lamented his Prophaning the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, as a Sin which provoked God to withdraw his Grace from him, which laid him Naked to all the Aſſaults of the Devil, ſo that no Sin ſeemed ſo horrid but he could without any check of Conſcience commit it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Birch,</hi> Sentenced for Killing two Boys of <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> Pariſh, <hi>viz. Edward Bunny</hi> and <hi>Samuel Wilſon,</hi> on the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> He was likewiſe very Penitent, and declared that Drunkenneſs had brought him to his untimely end; for he ſaid, had he not been in Drink, he might have eſcaped that horrid Sin of Murther he committed on thoſe Innocent Boys; and that never till then he had been Accuſed of the leaſt Miſdemeanor: And therefore he adviſed all People to beware of that Sin, which frequently has ſuch ſad Effects attending it, it being a Sin that drowns Reaſon, and makes a Man more Salvage than the moſt rapacious Beaſts, and expoſes him to all manner of Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Stanley</hi> and <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> Condemned for Robbing of <hi>John Clarke</hi> on the High-way, and taking from him a Mare, one Guirea 16 <hi>s.</hi> in Money, a Saddle, and other Goods, were no leſs Penitent than the former, making ample Confeſſion of their wicked courſe of Life, begging Pardon of God for all thoſe they had Injur'd, and freely For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their Proſecutors. But they utterly denied the Robbery charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them in <hi>Hartford-ſhire.</hi>

Let my Sins be covered, forſake me not, becauſe of them I have been a great Sinner, I have offended againſt thy Holy Laws, I have humbly confeſt them all.
